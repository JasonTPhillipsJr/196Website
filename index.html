        <strong>The Uses and Dangers of AI</strong>
    </h1>

        One thing that I find very interesting is <strong>AI</strong>.
        AI is an interesting area to study and learn about because it can have great impact on
        our <strong>&nbsp;careers</strong> and <strong>&nbsp;life</strong> in the near future. For example,
        there are some AI models that can get very close to writing a complete
        and proper program in very little time. This can be <strong>&nbsp;great for debugging errors</strong>,
        but <strong>&nbsp;dangerous because it can replace developers</strong>.
        A great example of such an AI would be
